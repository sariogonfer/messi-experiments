Compliance with breast self-examination (BSE) guidelines helps detect breast cancer early while increasing physical activity decreases the risk of having breast cancer. Finding ways to early initiate and maintain such behavior among youth is therefore important. In this study we aimed to determine the effects of two health promotion education interventions on knowledge and attitude to breast care, as well as practice of BSE and physical activity by female college students.
A total of 999 students from ten colleges underwent two kinds of health education strategies for three months, namely the traditional health education program (THEP) and tapping peer leaders using mobile phone prompts (PPHEP).
Improvement in knowledge and attitude was shown for both groups as compared to the control group. Both interventions equally increased the practice of BSE and maintenance of the recommended level of physical activity.
There was an increase in the knowledge and positive attitude to breast care and practice of BSE with an improvement in the level of exercise when THEP and PPHEP interventions were used. Health education with peers using mobile phone prompts offers an alternative and effective way of promoting BSE and acceptable levels of exercise.
