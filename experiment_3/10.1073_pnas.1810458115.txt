Guard cells have photosynthetically active chloroplasts in most plant species. However, the significance of their existence in guard cells or their developmental mechanisms is unknown. Here, through a forward-genetic approach, we have identified a key feature and a function of guard cell chloroplasts. We observed that a mutation that impaired chloroplast biogenesis in guard cells also disrupted the regulation of stomatal movements by CO and light. We demonstrated that guard cell chloroplasts, compared with those in mesophyll cells, display a unique lipid metabolism, in which the prokaryotic pathway is diminished and the eukaryotic pathway gains control. Our findings highlight the importance of the eukaryotic pathway for developing functional chloroplasts in guard cells.
