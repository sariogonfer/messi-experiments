Aim:
The aim of the present study is to compare the amount of remaining calculus, loss of tooth substance, and roughness of root surface after scaling and root planing with or without magnification loupes using scanning electron microscope.
Materials and Methods:
In the study, 30 teeth indicated for extractions due to severe chronic generalized periodontitis were included in the study. In test Group I, scaling and root planing was performed without magnification loupes, and in test Group II, scaling and root planing was performed with magnification loupes before extraction. In control Group III, no procedure was performed. After scaling and root planing, teeth were extracted followed by preparation of specimens. Specimens were then sent for scanning electron microscope study.
Results:
Statistically significant (P â‰¤ 0.05) differences were found among different test groups. Results showed that test Group II with magnification loupes had less remaining calculus and smoother surface with lesser amount of loss of cementum layer.
Conclusion:
From this, it was concluded that test Group II was more efficient in root debridement than test Group 1, so scaling and root planing done with magnification loupes will cause less damage to the tooth surface.
