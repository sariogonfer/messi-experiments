Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous disorder with decreased production of immunoglobulins that presents with recurrent and serious infections in âˆ¼90% of cases. Review of the literature showed only 12 cases of gastrointestinal infection of cytomegalovirus in patients with CVID. We present an unusual case of a CVID patient presenting with new-onset hematochezia. With proper clinical suspicion and endoscopic evaluation, cytomegalovirus colitis was diagnosed and acute bleeding was successfully treated endoscopically.
