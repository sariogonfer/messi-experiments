Aim:
The present study was aimed to compare the accuracy of Root ZX Mini and Propex II in the presence of 0.1% octinidine dohydrochloride (OCT), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), and 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) heated and nonheated before and after preparation.
Materials and Methods:
Eighty extracted single-rooted teeth were selected for the study and decoronated. Teeth were mounted in an alginate model. Actual working length (AL) was measured using a stereomicroscope under ×4 magnification. Electronic working length measurements were recorded using Root ZX Mini and Propex II apex locators in the presence of 0.1% OCT, 2% CHX, and 5% NaOCl (nonheated and heated to 60°C) before and after preparation. Mean and standard deviation differences before and after preparation were calculated and statistically analyzed using analysis of variance and paired t-test.
Results:
The accuracy of Root ZX Mini before and after preparation within ±0.5 mm of AL was consistently high in the presence of irrigants than Propex II. 5% NaOCl (heated and nonheated) showed more variation than the other irrigants, in the working length determination in both the apex locators.
Conclusion:
Electronic length measurements were shorter with heated and nonheated 5% NaOCl and longer with 0.1% OCT and 2% CHX for both the electronic apex locators.
