Multiresistant microorganism infection often can produce a life-threatening situation. We report two cases in which fecal microbiota transplantation used for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection were effective in eradicating colonization by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The presented cases illustrate the potential benefit of fecal microbiota transplantation in resolution of asymptomatic carrier states of multiresistant microorganisms, suggesting the need for further investigations with a view to their applicability in this area.
