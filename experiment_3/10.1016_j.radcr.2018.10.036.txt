We report a case of intratendinous patellar abscess and prepatellar septic bursitis following direct inoculation in a 26-year-old male injection drug user. The patient presented with 2 days of progressive knee pain, swelling, and erythema. Computed tomography demonstrated an enlarged patellar tendon with central low attenuation. Ultrasonography revealed a complex intratendinous fluid collection concerning for abscess. Aspiration of this fluid collection yielded grossly purulent fluid which grew methicillin-resistant staphylococcal aureus. The patient subsequently underwent operative debridement which revealed an intratendinous patellar abscess with extension to involve the prepatellar bursa. This case report demonstrates typical, though nonspecific, radiographic findings of abscess in an atypical location and highlights the importance of clinical history in diagnosing musculoskeletal disorders, particularly in the absence of traditional types of traumatic injury.
