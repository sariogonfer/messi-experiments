Hypertension is considered as an important public health problem in developed and developing countries. The disease is closely associated with health-promoting lifestyle (HPL), and it seems that HPL plays an important role in improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This cross-sectional study is to investigate the effects of health-promoting lifestyle (HPL) on health-related quality of life in elderly people with hypertension from a community health service center in Hengyang, Hunan, PR China.
Totally 530 elderly patients with hypertension from the community health service center were included in this study, who were asked to fill in a questionnaire (504 patients responded). HPL was assessed by the health-promoting lifestyle profile II (HPLP-II), and HRQOL was measured by the Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36).
HPL among these elderly people with hypertension was at moderate level (125.02 ± 21), with the highest score for nutrition and the lowest score for health responsibility. Moreover, HRQOL among these elderly hypertensive people was at moderate level (54.36 ± 21.18). Role-emotional domain score was far below average, vitality domain was a little below average, social functioning and general health domains were a little above average, and other domains were far above average. Furthermore, HPL and HRQOL were positively correlated (P <.01). According to the standardized regression coefficients, the influencing factors for HRQOL included (in a descending order) the health responsibility, physical activity, interpersonal relationships, stress management, spiritual growth, and nutrition.
HPL and HRQOL were both relatively poor in the elderly people with hypertension from the community health service center. HPL represents an important factor affecting HRQOL of elderly people with hypertension. HRQOL could be improved through promoting HPL (such as health responsibility and physical activity).
