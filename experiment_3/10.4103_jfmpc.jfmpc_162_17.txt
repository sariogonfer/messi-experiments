We present a rare case of Kikuchi disease in a young lady presenting with fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. Clinically, the disease mimics tuberculosis and lymphoma. Lymph node biopsy is diagnostic and treatment is symptomatic. Although tuberculosis is endemic, clinicians should be aware of uncommon conditions as early recognition of the disease will minimize unnecessary evaluation and treatment.
