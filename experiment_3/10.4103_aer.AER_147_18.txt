Hospital-acquired infections and their consequences are the main cause of morbidity/mortality in critically ill and immunocompromised patients. It becomes interesting when an unusual and uncommon microorganism is found to be the causative agent, rather than the known commensals and opportunists. We present such a case, when a multiparous female, in post lower uterine segment cesarean section period presented with fulminant septic shock, hepatic failure, coagulopathy, and ventilator-associated pneumonitis. The organism grown in the tracheal secretions turned out to be an uncommon, unusual Gram-negative Coccobacillus by the name of Pantoea dispersa, resistant to almost all the conventional antimicrobial agents. In spite of all the efforts, the patient could not be saved. However, the case has opened up a virtual “Pandora's box” of questions. Are these microorganisms, known plant pathogens, really harmful to humans? Are they commensals or virulent opportunists? Are we once again on the way to a new “Acinetobacter,” like near-epidemic? This is an attempt to try and find some insight about this presently uncommon and not well known genus of Pantoea! We have tried to trace and review the related available literature in the clinical medicine.
