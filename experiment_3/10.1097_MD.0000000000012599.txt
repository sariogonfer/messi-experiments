Rationale:
Hemolymphangioma of the pancreas is an extremely rare benign tumor; only 10 patients with this disease have been reported to date, the majority of whom were women.
Patient concerns:
We describe a 28-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain and discomfort. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data showed a huge heterogeneous solid cystic mass at the retroperitoneal pancreatic head. The maximum cross-sectional lengths of the pancreatic lesion were approximately 12 × 8.5 × 12 cm.
Diagnosis:
Hemolymphangioma of the pancreas.
Interventions:
The patient underwent a pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy; surgical excision is the main treatment for this type of tumor.
Outcomes:
The patient followed up regularly in the outpatient department for 6 months after surgery, and no sign of recurrence was found.
Lessons:
Although it is uncommon, clinicians ought to consider the diagnosis of hemolymphangioma of the pancreas upon detection of a pancreatic cystic lesion exhibiting fat or calcification.
