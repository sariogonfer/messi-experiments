Protozoal proteasome is a validated target for antimalarial drug development, but species selectivity of reported inhibitors is suboptimal. Here we identify inhibitors with improved selectivity for malaria proteasome β5 subunit over each active subunit of human proteasomes. These compounds kill the parasite in each stage of its life cycle. They interact synergistically with a β2 inhibitor and with artemisinin. Resistance to the β5 inhibitor arose through a point mutation in the nonproteolytic β6 subunit. The same mutation made the mutant strain more sensitive to a β2 inhibitor and less fit to withstand irradiation. These findings reveal complex interplay among proteasome subunits and introduce the prospect that combined inhibition of β2 and β5 subunits can afford synergy and thwart resistance.
