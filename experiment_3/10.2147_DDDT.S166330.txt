Bevacizumab, which is a humanized anti-VEGF antibody, has been successfully applied in clinics since 2004. Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy showed high safety and has been applied to solid tumors. However, studies on the insight into the mechanism about the antiangiogenesis activity of bevacizumab were mostly done on mice models, and so there are no visual and intuitive models to observe the process of antiangiogenesis. Here, we first used a zebrafish model to investigate the angiogenesis suppressing behavior of bevacizumab. Our results showed that bevacizumab inhibited formation of zebrafish subintestinal veins, which mimics the process of tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Meanwhile, bevacizumab caused specific vasculature formation defects in subintestinal veins but not in the trunk. Our study also indicated that bevacizumab could inhibit zebrafish retinal angiogenesis with therapeutic potential.
