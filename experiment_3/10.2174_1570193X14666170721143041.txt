Background:
Aquilaria, a genus belonging to the Thymelaeaceae, produces fragrant resinous agarwood, also known as eaglewood, which has been used as incense since old times. The intense fra-grance is the result of the presence of a wide variety of secondary metabolites.
Objective:
This genus was reported contained sesquiterpenes, chromones, flavonoids, benzophenones, diterpenoids, triterpenoids, and lignans.
Conclusion:
Here, we review the different secondary metabolites that have been identified in Aquilaria to show their diversity and to allow comparison with other Thymelaeaceae genera.
