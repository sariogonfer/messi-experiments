Hospitals in the Asia‐Pacific today face the ‘triple aim’ challenge, proposed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, of how to improve quality of care and population health, while at the same time controlling healthcare costs. Yet, pursuing these challenges in combination is presently a remote prospect for many hospitals and, indeed, in a majority of countries in the region. The roles and functions of the public hospital sector within local health systems need redefinition and reform in the context of demographic and epidemiological transitions. Policymakers, managers and health professionals have an obligation to reshape the future of public hospitals. This article outlines actions for how public hospitals can be reshaped from a health system perspective. First, hospitals should be integrated into the fabric of the local health system; they can lead in this through working in alliances with other healthcare facilities, including primary care and private hospitals. Policymakers have a role in facilitating this as it contributes to health improvement of the population. Second, investments in system innovation, management improvement and information systems are required and their impact assessed. Such investments can contribute to cost control and efficiency. Public hospital sector investments should be strategic, efficient and should not bias investment in broader determinants of health. Third, reorienting health workforce competencies and appropriate skills should be central to hospital sector reforms, from policy to frontline services delivery. Creative thinking is needed to build and support flexible care delivery arrangements for services designed to respond to patients ’ and providers’ needs. Pivotal to achievement of each of these three areas of reform is good governance and leadership.
