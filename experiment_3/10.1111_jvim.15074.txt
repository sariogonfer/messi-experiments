An 18‐month‐old male Akita Inu dog developed fever and lameness 8 months after successful transcatheter closure of a patent ductus arteriosus with an Amplatz Canine Duct Occluder (ACDO). Corynebacterium species were cultured from 3 blood samples. Echocardiography showed a vegetative process on the aortic valves. The dog died spontaneously 3 days after development of the initial signs. Necropsy confirmed the presence of bacterial ductal arteritis and myocarditis, and revealed an incomplete endothelialization of the intraductal metal implant. The reason for the lack of (neo)endothelialization of the ACDO remains unknown. We conclude that late‐onset bacterial device‐related ductal arteritis can develop in dogs where the implant is incompletely covered by a protective endothelial layer.
