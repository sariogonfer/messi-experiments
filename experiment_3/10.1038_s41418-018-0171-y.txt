STAT3 is an oncogenic transcription factor exerting its functions both as a canonical transcriptional activator and as a non-canonical regulator of energy metabolism and mitochondrial functions. While both activities are required for cell transformation downstream of different oncogenic stimuli, they rely on different post-translational activating events, namely phosphorylation on either Y705 (nuclear activities) or S727 (mitochondrial functions). Here, we report the discovery of the unexpected STAT3 localization to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), from where it modulates ER-mitochondria Ca release by interacting with the Ca channel IP3R3 and facilitating its degradation. The release of Ca is of paramount importance for life/death cell decisions, as excessive Ca causes mitochondrial Ca overload, the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and the initiation of the intrinsic apoptotic program. Indeed, STAT3 silencing enhances ER Ca release and sensitivity to apoptosis following oxidative stress in STAT3-dependent mammary tumor cells, correlating with increased IP3R3 levels. Accordingly, basal-like mammary tumors, which frequently display constitutively active STAT3, show an inverse correlation between IP3R3 and STAT3 protein levels. These results suggest that STAT3-mediated IP3R3 down-regulation in the ER crucially contributes to its anti-apoptotic functions via modulation of Ca fluxes.
