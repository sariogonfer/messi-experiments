Spontaneous external jugular venous (EJV) aneurysms are usually attributed to hypertension or trauma or proximity to high pressure arteries as result of anatomical variation.Spontaneous EJV aneurysms are exceptionally rare but should still be considered in the differential diagnosis of a neck mass.Surgical excision of external jugular venous (EJV) aneurysms should be performed if the condition causes symptoms and/or cosmetic discomfort, to prevent possible and future thrombo-embolic complications and to achieve definitive histopathologic diagnosis.
