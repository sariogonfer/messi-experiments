Objective: The goal of this study was to estimate the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Georgia. Method: A population-based study was conducted using Georgian version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and its cognitive domain index score. Results: Of the initial cohort of 1,000 subjects, 851 met inclusion criteria. The prevalence of MCI was 13.3%, and it was associated with age >65 years (odds ratio [OR] = 4.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [3.00, 6.75]), urban residence (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = [0.33, 0.88]), lower education (OR = 3.99, 95% CI = [2.66, 5.93]), and hypertension (OR = 2.51, 95% CI = [1.68, 3.76]), while amnestic MCI was documented in 9.3%, with higher risk in older subjects (OR = 2.69, 95% CI = [1.66, 4.20]), and diabetics (OR = 2.69, 95% CI = [1.25, 5.98]). Conclusion: In this first population-based study of MCI in Georgia, prevalence was comparable with those reported from the United States and Europe. Observed association of MCI with cardiovascular risk factors has important clinical implication for dementia prevention in Georgia.
