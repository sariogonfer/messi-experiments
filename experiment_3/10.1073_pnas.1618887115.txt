Explaining correlations across space of cyclic dynamics in ecology is a fundamental challenge. We apply ideas from statistical physics, originally used to explain the behavior of magnets, to a dataset on yield from pistachio trees, obtaining a robust description and potential explanation for the generation of spatial correlations in cyclic dynamics. These results suggest looking for mechanistic underpinnings at the level of interactions between neighboring trees that lead to spatial correlations in dynamics and a surprising correspondence between the descriptions of physical phenomena, magnetization, and ecological dynamics. This work demonstrates with data, and not just models, that correlations in cyclic dynamics can be generated from local interactions and dynamics even in a very noisy ecological system.
