The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a single-portal endoscopic desmotomy of the PAL with the use of Arthrex - Centerline™. Ten horse distal front limbs from horses free of PAL disease were prepared for tenoscopy of the digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS). A dual-port endoscopic desmotomy with a hook knife was performed in 5 specimens (Group A) and single port Arthrex-Centerline™ Desmotomy was performed in another 5 specimens (Group B). The performing time, judgments of the surgeon, number of blade passages, and gross anatomy were evaluated. The performing time and surgeon judgments were significantly lower in Group B. No significant differences were assessed in number of passages to achieve a complete PAL resection and a gross anatomy evaluation. The use of Arthrex-Centerline™ is feasible for a PAL desmotomy procedure. It was faster with more handling ease compared with the free-hand double-portal desmotomy and allowed the same results in terms of number of passages to complete the release evaluated at gross anatomy.
