Purpose:
To report endoscope-assisted fascia lata harvest (EAFH) as a minimally-invasive technique for correction of severe blepharoptosis.
Methods:
This was a retrospective case series between January 2013 and April 2017. Medical records of all consecutive patients who underwent frontalis suspension by EAFH in the study period were reviewed and outcome was analyzed.
Results:
Fourteen patients (10 males) were included in the study. Mean age of the group was 18.14 + 17.03 years (range 4-65 years) and 11 patients had simple congenital blepharoptosis. Blepharophimosis syndrome was seen in 3 patients. Eleven patients had bilateral blepharoptosis. The mean preoperative and postoperative MRD1 was –1.60 ± 0.87 mm and +2.12 ± 1.37 mm respectively. Mean lengths of the incision and fascial harvest were 2.25 ± 0.43 cm and 13.0 ± 2.35 cm (range 10-17 cm) respectively. The median follow-up of patients was 4.57 + 4.03 months (range 1-15 months). Complications included a wound dehiscence in two patients and these were resutured. The donor sites healed well in all patients leaving a small thigh scar and none needed scar revision.
Conclusion:
EAFH is a promising minimally-invasive technique performed with a small incision and achieved adequate length of fascial harvest.
