Objective
This study was performed to determine the effect of the remifentanil dose on the onset time of rocuronium with electromyography.
Methods
This retrospective comparative study included 75 patients undergoing general anesthesia for elective surgery. Patients received lidocaine (40 mg) and propofol (2 mg/kg) followed by rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) with either saline infusion (Group S), remifentanil at 0.5 µg/kg/minute (Group R 0.5), or remifentanil at 1.0 µg/kg/minute (Group R 1.0). Neuromuscular block was monitored by train-of-four (TOF) electromyography, and the times taken to reach TOF 0 and TOF ratio (TOFR) 25% were recorded.
Results
The times taken to reach TOF 0 and TOFR 25% were significantly higher in Groups R 0.5 and R 1.0 than in Group S. The time taken to reach TOF 0 was 130.0 ± 6.4 s in Group S, 142.6 ± 6.0 s in Group R 0.5, and 183.0 ± 11.6 s in Group R 1.0. The time taken to reach TOFR 25% was also higher in Groups R 0.5 and R 1.0 than in Group S.
Conclusions
As the remifentanil dose increases, the intubation time required to reach TOF 0 also increases. Remifentanil has an effect on the onset of rocuronium.
