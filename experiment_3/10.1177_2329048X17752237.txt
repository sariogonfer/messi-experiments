PRUNE syndrome, or neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, hypotonia, and variable brain anomalies (OMIM#617481), is a new rare autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disease that is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in PRUNE1 on chromosome 1q21. Here, We report on 12-month-old and 30-month-old girls from 2 unrelated Saudi families with typical presentations of PRUNE syndrome. Both patients had severe developmental delay, progressive microcephaly, and dysmorphic features. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed slight thinning in the corpus callosum, mild frontal brain atrophy, and delayed myelination in one of the patients. Both patients had the same missense mutation in PRUNE1 (c.383G>A, p.Arg128Gln), which was not reported before in a homozygous state. We compared our patients to previously reported cases. In conclusion, We suggest that clinicians consider PRUNE syndrome in any child presenting with dysmorphic features, developmental delay, progressive microcephaly, central hypotonia, peripheral spasticity, delayed myelination, brain atrophy, and a thin corpus callosum.
