[Purpose] This study aimed to investigate the effects of McKenzie exercise, Kinesio taping, and myofascial release (MFR) on forward head posture (FHP). [Participants and Methods] Twenty-eight individuals with an FHP were enrolled. participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group A, Group B and Group C. Group A underwent McKenzie exercise and MFR. Group B underwent McKenzie exercise and Kinesio taping. Group C underwent McKenzie exercise, MFR, and Kinesio taping. Interventions for all three groups were provided three times per week for four weeks. The acromion and tragus of ear (A-T length), craniovertebral angle (CVA), Cranial rotation angle (CRA), and neck disability index (NDI) were measured. [Results] The A-T length significantly differed after intervention in all three groups. CVA only significantly differed after intervention in group C. All three groups showed an increase in CRA after intervention; however, these increases were not statistically significant. [Conclusion] Considering these results, these three types of exercise may be recommended as effective exercises to improve posture in adults with FHP.
