Acute liver injury is an alarming condition, as it may lead to a devastating outcome. Of the many causes of acute liver injury, review of medications is crucial to identifying the cause of the injury. Some commonly used medications may unpredictably be the underlying cause of liver injury. We present a case of Peyronie's disease treated with potassium para-aminobenzoate that developed acute liver injury. After starting the new treatment, the patient complained of right upper quadrant pain. He was found to have elevated liver enzymes. The condition resolved after stopping potassium para-aminobenzoate use. We report a potassium para-aminobenzoate side effect of liver injury that can be managed conservatively.
