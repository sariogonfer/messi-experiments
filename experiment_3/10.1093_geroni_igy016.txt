Background and Objectives
Evidence suggests participation in evidence-based programs by older adults is effective, yet most studies focus on participation in a single evidence-based program, leaving repeated participation insufficiently understood. We aimed to compare participation in multiple evidence-based programs (repeaters) versus a single evidence-based program (nonrepeaters).
Research Design and Methods
Secondary data analysis was conducted on pre–post longitudinal data targeting older adults participating in evidence-based program(s) in Texas (2013–2016). Surveys included sociodemographic and health-related indicators (e.g., self-rated health, health behaviors, and falls-risks). Mixed-effects models examined pre–post changes in health-related indicators.
Results
Of the 734 study-eligible participants, 145 (20%) participated in two or more evidence-based programs. The participants’ average age was 74 years, and the majority was female (80%), non-Hispanic White (79%), or lived in urban or large rural cities/towns (79%). At baseline, repeaters reported less depressive symptomology (p =.049), fewer chronic conditions (p =.048), and less concern of falling (p =.030) than nonrepeaters. Repeaters had better workshop attendance and completion rates (p <.001). Compared to nonrepeaters, repeaters showed significantly-better improvements in communication with physicians (p =.013).
Discussion and Implications
Study findings suggest potential benefits of participation in multiple evidence-based program workshops, but repeaters may have different health profiles than nonrepeaters in natural settings. Future evaluations should consider participants’ past participations in evidence-based programs. Further research is needed to build more comprehensive evidence about the incremental benefits of participation in multiple evidence-based programs.
