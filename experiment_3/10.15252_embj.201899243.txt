Here, we describe a one‐step, in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease‐mediated strategy to generate knock‐in mice. We produced knock‐in (KI) mice wherein a 1.9‐kb DNA fragment bearing a pre‐arranged human B‐cell receptor heavy chain was recombined into the native murine immunoglobulin locus. Our methodology relies on Cas9 nuclease‐induced double‐stranded breaks directed by two sgRNAs to occur within the specific target locus of fertilized oocytes. These double‐stranded breaks are subsequently repaired via homology‐directed repair by a plasmid‐borne template containing the pre‐arranged human immunoglobulin heavy chain. To validate our knock‐in mouse model, we examined the expression of the KI immunoglobulin heavy chains by following B‐cell development and performing single B‐cell receptor sequencing. We optimized this strategy to generate immunoglobulin KI mice in a short amount of time with a high frequency of homologous recombination (30–50%). In the future, we envision that such knock‐in mice will provide much needed vaccination models to evaluate immunoresponses against immunogens specific for various infectious diseases.
