Purpose
To assess if postponing surgery of paediatric supracondylar humerus fractures (SCHF) without compromised blood circulation to office hours can improve the quality of reduction and pin fixation and decrease complications.
Methods
In 2004, night-time (0am to 7am) surgery was allowed only for children with compromised blood circulation. Number of open reductions, surgeons experience, operation time, quality of reduction (Baumann angle, anterior humeral line crossing point with capitellum) and pin fixation as well as the number of complications were compared in 100 children before (A) and 100 after (B) the new protocol. Surgery was commenced during office hours (8am to 3pm) in 27% (A) versus 55% (B) and delay to surgery from admission exceeded six hours in 25% (A) versus 52% (B) of the children.
Results
Open reduction was performed in eight (A) versus 11 (B) children. In group A, 40% were operated on by a registrar alone compared with 14% in group B. Mean operation room time decreased by 11 minutes in group B. Radiographic alignment was satisfactory at fracture union in 68% (A) versus 68% (B) and radiologically stable pin fixation in 42% (A) versus 55% (B) of children (p = 0.08). The was no statistical difference in admission time, re-reductions, infections, permanent iatrogenic nerve injuries or corrective osteotomies between the patient groups.
Conclusions
No statistical difference in quality of reduction or pin fixation or in number of complications was observed. Postponing operative treatment of SCHF without vascular compromise increased consultant attendance in operations and decreased operative room time.
