The TRAPP complexes are nucleotide exchange factors that activate Rab GTPases, and four different versions of TRAPP have been reported. Thomas et al. show that only two versions of TRAPP are detectable in normal cells and demonstrate that the TRAPPIII complex regulates Golgi trafficking in addition to its established role in autophagy.
