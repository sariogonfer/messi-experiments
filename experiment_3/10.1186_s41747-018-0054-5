To assess the feasibility of a novel system that uses augmented reality to guide interventional oncology procedures.
This study was conducted in accordance to the guidelines of the local institutional review boards. Evaluation of an augmented reality system based upon a tablet, a needle handle and a set of markers was performed in three experimental models. Initially, a male anthropomorphic trunk phantom equipped with five polyvinyl chloride bars (two of 16 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter and four of 45, 30 or 20 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter) was used to study the accuracy of the system without respiratory motion or tissue compression. Next, small metallic targets were placed in a porcine model to evaluate how respiration affects the system accuracy. Finally, the performance of the system on a more complete model, a cadaver with liver metastasis, was tested.
In all experimental settings, extremely high targeting accuracy of < 5 mm in all cases was achieved: 2.0 ± 1.5 mm (mean ± standard deviation) for the anthropomorphic model, 3.9 ± 0.4 mm for the porcine model, and 2.5 mm and 2.8 mm for the two metastases in the cadaver model.
Augmented reality can assist with needle guidance with great target accuracy for interventional procedures by simultaneously visualising three-dimensional reconstructed anatomical structures, tumour targets and interventional devices on a patient’s body, enabling performance of procedures in a simple and confident way.
