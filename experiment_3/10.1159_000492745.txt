Purpose
The BrightOcular® implants are the newest model of cosmetic iris devices that are currently advertised as safe. The previous generation known as NewColorIris® have had severe ocular side effects and were subsequently withdrawn from the market. There is little literature on the safety profile of BrightOcular® implants.
Case Report
Herein we describe two cases with varying degrees of ocular tolerability. The first case had a normal ocular exam 1 year after implantation, whereas the second case had unilateral severe corneal edema requiring explantation of the iris device and Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty 9 months after bilateral implantation.
Conclusions
These two cases attest to the unpredictability of the results of these cosmetic surgeries. Patients should be counseled about the vision-threatening complications of iris implants.
