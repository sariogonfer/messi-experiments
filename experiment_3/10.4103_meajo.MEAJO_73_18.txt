Uveal melanoma is the most common intraocular malignant tumor, with the choroid being the most common site. Management of choroidal melanoma has evolved greatly over the past years. In the past, the conventional method of treatment was enucleation of the affected eye with a debate regarding the effect of enucleation to promote or prevent metastasis. However, nowadays, there are many therapeutic options available including plaque radiotherapy, proton beam radiotherapy, argon laser photocoagulation, transpupillary thermotherapy, stereotactic radiotherapy using gamma knife, enucleation, and surgical resection of the tumor whether through transscleral approach “Exoresection” or less commonly through internal resection approach “Endoresection.” The indications and complications of each technique are reviewed. Although radiotherapy is the primary treatment of choroidal melanoma in most ocular oncology centers, it is used as an adjuvant therapy in combination with surgical resection. Preoperative stereotactic radiotherapy before endoresection and brachytherapy to the surgical bed in both exo and endoresection can effectively decrease the recurrence rate. In this article, we will focus on surgical resection of choroidal melanoma whether endoresection or exoresection. We collected data published in indexed journals and related books.
