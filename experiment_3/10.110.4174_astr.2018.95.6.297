Increased robotic surgery is attended by increased reports of complications, largely due to limited operative view and lack of tactile sense. These kinds of obstacles, which seldom occur in open surgery, are challenging for beginner surgeons. To enhance robotic surgery safety, we created an augmented reality (AR) model of the organs around the thyroid glands, and tested the AR model applicability in robotic thyroidectomy.
We created AR images of the thyroid gland, common carotid arteries, trachea, and esophagus using preoperative CT images of a thyroid carcinoma patient. For a preliminary test, we overlaid the AR images on a 3-dimensional printed model at five different angles and evaluated its accuracy using Dice similarity coefficient. We then overlaid the AR images on the real-time operative images during robotic thyroidectomy.
The Dice similarity coefficients ranged from 0.984 to 0.9908, and the mean of the five different angles was 0.987. During the entire process of robotic thyroidectomy, the AR images were successfully overlaid on the real-time operative images using manual registration.
We successfully demonstrated the use of AR on the operative field during robotic thyroidectomy. Although there are currently limitations, the use of AR in robotic surgery will become more practical as the technology advances and may contribute to the enhancement of surgical safety.
